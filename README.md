This Python code is a simple text-based coffee vending machine simulation.
It allows users to select coffee drinks (espresso, latte, or cappuccino) by providing their choice and then processes payments using virtual coins.
The code keeps track of resources (water, milk, and coffee) and profit. Users can also request a report of the current resource levels and profit.
